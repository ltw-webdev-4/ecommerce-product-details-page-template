# Product details page template

## Overview

- _Work only on your teammate’s `ecommerce-pattern-library` that you cloned to your computer_—**ensure you only make commits to the `product-details` branch.**
- Use their designed patterns to create the page that lists all details for a single product.
- You should already have a wireframe and appropriate documentation to complete your task.
- **You should only be working within the `product.html` layout—this file represents the view for every single product on their website.**
- _You should only write HTML and insert appropriate classes like `.grid` and type sizes._
- **DO NOT make any adjustments to any other files in the pattern library—the only file you can touch is the `product.html` layout.** If something can’t be created you need to chat with your teammate to come up with a solution.
- **The product details page does not get its own CSS file.** If you cannot create the page without writing CSS, talk to your teammate to better understand the patterns you’re supposed to use.

## Pattern library updates

If you run into a situation where your teammate needs to update their pattern library [follow the steps in the “Updating from master” lesson](https://learntheweb.courses/courses/web-dev-4/updating-from-master/).

**This shouldn’t happen though—because everybody has thought ahead and made ready everything necessary for the product details page. (\*wink \*wink)**

## Hand in

During the next class you and your teammate will integrate the new page into their original code.

Show the teacher the completed version after the integration.
